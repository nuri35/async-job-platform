# Best Practices

## API Design

1. Use consistent naming conventions
2. Version your APIs from the start
3. Document with OpenAPI/Swagger
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Use appropriate HTTP status codes
6. Support pagination for collections
7. Implement rate limiting
8. Use HTTPS for all endpoints

### Database

1. Design schema with normalization in mind
2. Add indexes for frequently queried columns
3. Use transactions for data consistency
4. Implement soft deletes where appropriate
5. Use UUIDs for distributed systems
6. Plan for data migration from day one
7. Backup regularly and test restoration

### Security

1. Never store passwords in plain text
2. Validate and sanitize all inputs
3. Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Use HTTPS/TLS for all communication
6. Keep dependencies updated
7. Follow principle of least privilege
8. Implement proper CORS policies

### Performance

1. Cache frequently accessed data
2. Use database indexes strategically
3. Implement pagination for large datasets
4. Optimize N+1 queries
5. Use connection pooling
6. Implement lazy loading
7. Profile and optimize slow queries
8. Use CDN for static assets

### Reliability

1. Implement circuit breakers
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Design for idempotency
4. Implement graceful degradation
5. Use health checks and readiness probes
6. Plan for disaster recovery
7. Monitor and alert on critical metrics
